# About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ethan Almloff, a passionate programmer and AI enthusiast with a strong background in C#, Unity, Python, and Machine Learning. I'm dedicated to exploring the exciting intersections of technology, creativity, and artificial intelligence.

## Background

I embarked on my coding journey by diving into the world of C# and Unity, where I honed my skills in game development and interactive experiences. The blend of logic and creativity in game development laid a solid foundation for my programming career.

As I delved deeper into the realm of coding, I found myself drawn to the captivating realm of Python and Machine Learning. The ability to teach machines to learn from data and make intelligent decisions fascinated me. This led me to explore various libraries and frameworks, enabling me to develop practical applications powered by AI.

## Current Focus

Currently, I'm actively working on a fascinating project that combines my passion for memories, images, and AI. I'm developing an application that maps images to a 2D plane, essentially translating memories into a visual landscape using the power of AI encoding. This project is a beautiful fusion of technology and emotion, allowing me to explore the creative possibilities of AI-generated art.

## GitHub Contributions

My GitHub is a reflection of my coding journey and my commitment to open-source collaboration. You'll find a diverse range of repositories showcasing my projects, experiments, and contributions to the developer community. Feel free to explore my work and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas!
