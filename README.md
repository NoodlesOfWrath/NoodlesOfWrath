# About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ethan Almloff, a dedicated programmer with experience in C, C#, Unity, Python, and my favorite, Rust ðŸ¦€.

## Current Focus

Currently, I am working on improving [ACL](https://github.com/NoodlesOfWrath/ACL), an HDL for analog. However, I don't have as much time as I would like to dedicate to ACL.

## Get in Touch

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, AI enthusiasts, and creative minds. Whether you want to discuss coding, AI, or just chat about the latest tech trends, feel free to reach out to me through Discord @noodlesofwrath, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-almloff-12312b280/), or by email at ethanalmloff@gmail.com. Let's build the future together, one line of code at a time!

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding! ðŸ˜„ðŸš€
