# About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ethan Almloff, a passionate programmer and AI enthusiast with a strong background in C#, Unity, Python, and Machine Learning. I'm dedicated to exploring the exciting intersections of technology, creativity, and artificial intelligence.

## Current Focus

Currently, I'm actively working on a fascinating project that combines my passion for memories, images, and AI. I'm developing an application that maps images to a 2D plane, essentially translating memories into a visual landscape using the power of AI encoding. This project is a beautiful fusion of technology and emotion, allowing me to explore the creative possibilities of AI-generated art. I am also learning rust ðŸ¦€ in making a fluid simulation.

## Get in Touch

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, AI enthusiasts, and creative minds. Whether you want to discuss coding, AI, or just chat about the latest tech trends, feel free to reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-almloff-12312b280/) or on Discord @noodlesofwrath. Let's build the future together, one line of code at a time!

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding! ðŸ˜„ðŸš€
